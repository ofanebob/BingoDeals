# BingoDeals
People are always looking for great deals around them wherever they stay or traveling, but still there are no flexible solutions to meet their demands except traditional method such as email marketing, social media ads etc. It is difficult and irritating to check emails for deals around them, but if we can give updates automatically about deals to our smart phones wherever we travel, it is
really awesome.

Main objective of this app is to send deal alerts when the locations are discovered. If mobile has GPS, deals can be sent as mails (notification popup). Addition to that it finds userâ€™s current location plotted on a map and displays details of nearby discovered sites such as address, phone number, distance from current location, ratings, reviews etc.
